## About Me

Hello! I'm David, a passionate programmer and full-stack web developer with leadership and research skills. I'm on a mission to make a significant impact in my community and beyond. I'm a former Microsoft Intern at the Bing team and deeply involved in various tech initiatives at Florida International University.
