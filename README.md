## About Me

Hello! I'm David, a passionate programmer and full-stack engineer with leadership and research skills. I'm on a mission to make a significant impact in my community and beyond. I'm a former Google Software Engineering Intern where I worked on parsing code repositories for LLM context. Currently working on applying my skills in deep learning through research.

- **INIT FIU - President** - Miami, Florida (Jan 2024 - December 2024)
  - Former Director of Technology (Jan 2023 - December 2023)
  - Skills: Full-Stack Development, TypeScript, Docker, CSPs (AWS), Project Management
- **Google** - Software Engineering Intern (May 2024 - August 2024)
  - Location: Sunnyvale, California 
  - Developed and designed end-to-end RAG system in Kotlin, Go, and TypeScript for user git repositories, informing external and internal chat systems on relevant code for user queries, integrating with larger micro-service architecture / frontend.
  - Constructed pipeline for processing repositories, fetching repositories from distributed crawling service, building an Abstract Syntax Tree for finding important snippets, generating code-specific embeddings, and doing similarity search based on a user query.
- **Prev. SWE + PM Intern @ Microsoft** (May 2023 - August 2023)
  - Location: Redmond, Washington
  - Used SQL-like language for data analytics of big data to decide coverage of a [Bing Explorational Search Box](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K73hFHpGcPHcD89lvNLv1ABPVsLmzt4t/view?usp=sharing), settling on 1% of Bing traffic - 1 million daily users.
  - Studied and implemented prompt engineering for the generation of content used in a Bing Explorational Search Box, then made change with C# framework [so results can be passed to the frontend UX teams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u42lAJZdYxqgZm_XwzmCSLEuH-V0HBM3/view?usp=sharing).

## Publications
